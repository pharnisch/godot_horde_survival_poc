# Horde Survival Game with i) Fixed Difficulty Mode, and ii) Adaptable Difficulty Mode

i) should be in the middle of the spectrum of ii).

## Ideas for ii)

### Estimating Player Skill
- Health
- Score/Time
- Enemy Living Time (decreases while enemy live, see "Halls of Torment Agony Mode")

### Adapting to Player Skill
- Decrease Player Power: Less Movement Speed, Damage, Abilities, ...
- Increase Environment Power: 
- Spawning More Enemies or Objectiles that have to be dodged
- Irritating Visuals: Colors/Rotations/Darkness/...

## Prevent that People Can "Exploit" Difficulty-Adaptation by e.g. loosing health on purpose to make the game easier and get higher scores
- Increase score received with higher difficulty level
- Make higher difficulty levels more fun and engaging/visually appealing
-
